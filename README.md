## Landing-page

Create an entire <strong>web page</strong> from a design provided by <em>The Odin Project</em>, getting the project as close as possible to the design.<br>

The assignment point is:
- to create something from scratch
- get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

Substitude content and personalize as desired.

<strong>Please note:</strong> beauty salons generally tend to use web pages with white and light backgrounds. I consciously chose to use a more vibrant background image, as it was an excellent opportunity to experiment.
